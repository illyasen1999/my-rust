/*
    Usually variables in Rust are by default immutable unless you want to change it to be mutable by adding the keyword "mut" before the variable name

    Variable - storage for a value ex. strings and numbers

    Immutability - you cant change the value
    
    Mutability - you can modify the value
    
    Constants - unchangable values can cannot use "mut", in const you must add the type to the variable, and constants are named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    
    Shadowing - declaring a variable of the same name and taking the value of the previous one as the last variable is being overshadowed by the new one

    Difference between Shadowing and Mutability is in shadowing you can use the value of the previous variable but with being mutable you cant use the value of the previous variable

    Scalar Types - represents a single value, and there are 4 types Integer, Floating point number, Booleans, and Characters

    Integers & Floats can occupy 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits of space while usize and isize depends on the architecture of the system

    Compound Types - can group multiple values into one type, Rust has 2 compound types: Tuples and Arrays

    Heap Memory - is a dynamic option for storing memory that can be resized and continue to retain the value even after the scope ends

    Stack Memory - is automatically allocated and deallocated and essentially stores the local variables within the function's scope

    Function - a block of code that will run if called, you can also add parameters inside "()" and also have return types ex. fn some_fn(a: i32) -> i32 {...}

    Statements - are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
    
    Expressions - evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.

    Comments - mostly used for documentation and explenation of complex code, comments wont be seen by the compiler. Comments are written after double slashes // or between /**/

    Control Flow - run code depdending whether a condition is true, there is if..else loop, for loop, loop, and while loop

    If you have multiple if..else blocks its best to refactor your if..else code with match statement
